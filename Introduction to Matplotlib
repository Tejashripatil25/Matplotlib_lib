### What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.

Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.

Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.

Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.

### Installation of Matplotlib:

If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.

### Install it using this command:

C:\Users\Your Name>pip install matplotlib

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed,  like Anaconda, Spyder etc.

### Import Matplotlib

import matplotlib

### Pyplot

Most of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot submodule, and are usually imported under the plt alias:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Now the Pyplot package can be referred to as plt.

### Example: Get your own Python Server

Draw a line in a diagram from position (0,0) to position (6,250):

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import numpy as np

xpoints = np.array([0, 6])

ypoints = np.array([0, 250])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)

plt.show()
